        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
        joned. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

        "I was an EMT for many years before I joind the bootcamp. I'v been looking to make transition and have heard
        some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and fount it incredibly
        fun! I enrolled shortly there after. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life.
        Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
        startup."

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
        their experiences was easy.

        "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find really refreshing. The program gave me the
        confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
        myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you
        need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
      </h3>
      <p>
        "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.I needed some structure from professionals who
        can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
        only say wonderful things
        about the program.
        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
        They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. the agile team project in particular, was
        outstanding.
        It took my learning to the next level in a way that not tutorial could ever have.
        In fact, I've often referrred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!."
